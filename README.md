A Computer Science Student at Habib University, passionate about exploring various facets of technology. I'm currently diving deep into the dynamic world of Web Development, where I'm honing my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React.js and Node.js. As a graphic designer and 3D modeler, I love blending creativity with technology to craft visually stunning digital experiences.

In addition to web development, I'm proficient in Python, C, and C++, where I enjoy delving into the intricacies of software development and exploring the endless possibilities these languages offer.

With a keen interest in Data Science, I'm fascinated by the power of data to drive insights and make informed decisions. I've worked with databases like MySQL and MongoDB in my data science projects, leveraging their capabilities to analyze and extract valuable insights from large datasets.

I've been delving into Figma, a powerful tool for interface design and prototyping. As a graphic designer and 3D modeler, I find Figma immensely valuable for creating intuitive user interfaces and streamlining the design process. It's an integral part of my toolkit for bringing creative visions to life in the digital realm.
